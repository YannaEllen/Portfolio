            This website is my final project on the Specialization I'm taking by the University of Michigan available on the Coursera website.
            Web Design for Everybody: Basics of Web Development &amp; Coding was taught by the professor Colleen Van Lent. In this specialization I had to go through five courses: Introduction to HTML5, Introduction to CSS3, Interactivity with Java Script, Advanced Styling with Responsive Design and last but not least, Web Design for Everybody Capstone.

              My name is Yanna, I'm 26 years old and I'm from Brazil. I came to the USA to work as an Au Pair, and in order to stay here for two years we must take a course during the first year. Many Au Pairs take English courses during their stay here, however, since I was an English Teacher in Brazil I decided I wanted to do something completely different from what I was used to. I always wanted to know more about programming and technology. After talking to some friends from the area I decided to try Web Design.
